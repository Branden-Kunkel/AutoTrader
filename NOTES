TODO:
- use os.path for path types?
- continue refining error handling for api_libs library to make it more concise and readable
- update cmd for api_libs to allow for full usage of the singular library as a standalone with options


Notes:
- program timestamp is naive datetime. it uses local system time, not accounting for timezones (this may change)
